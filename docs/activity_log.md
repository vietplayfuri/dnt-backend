##How to Add new Activity

1. Add new entry to enum [ActivityLogType](../costs.net.dataAccess/Entity/ActivityLogType.cs) with an integer value.
2. Create a new DotLiquid template for the ActivityLogType to the [activity_log_message_template table](../costs.net.database/migration/schema/V1.1/V1.1.41__Create_activity_log_message_template_table.sql) in a [migration script](../costs.net.database/migration/schema/V1.1/V1.1.42__Add_cost_created_template.sql).
3. Create a new class that derives from [ActivityLogEntryBase](../costs.net.core/Models/ActivityLog/ActivityLogEntryBase.cs).
4. Use the new class written in Step 3 with the [IActivityLogService](../costs.net.core/Services/ActivityLog/IActivityLogService.cs) in the place where the [activity occurs](https://git.adstream.com/adstream-costs/costs.net/blob/develop/costs.net.core/Services/Workflow/WorkflowService.cs#L98-99).
5. [Extend PaperPusher](https://git.adstream.com/adbank-5/paper-pusher/merge_requests/221) to add the new activity. The name of the activity in PaperPusher must match the entry in the DotLiquid template.
6. Done
